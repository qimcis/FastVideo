### What is this?

As state-of-the-art video diffusion models grow in size and sequence length, their become prohibitive to use. For instance, sampling a 5-second 720P video with Hunyuan takes 13 minutes on 4 X A100. FastVideo aim to make large video diffusion models fast to infer and efficient to train, and thus making them more **accessible**. 

We introduce FastMochi and FastHunyuan, distilled versions of the Mochi and Hunyuan video diffusion models. The distilled models are 8X faster to sample.



### What can I do with FastVideo?
Other than the distilled weight, FastVideo provides a pipeline for training, distilling, and inferencing video diffusion models. Key capabilities include:

- **Scalable**: FastVideo supports FSDP, sequence parallelism, and selective gradient checkpointing. Our code seamlessly scales to 64 GPUs in our test.
- **Memory Efficient**: FastVideo supports LoRA finetuning coupled with precomputed latents and text embeddings for minimal memory usage.
- **Variable Sequence length**: You can finetune with both image and videos.

## Change Log

- ```2024/12/16```: `FastVideo` v0.1 is released.


## ðŸ”§ Installation
The code is tested on Python 3.10.0, CUDA 12.1 and H100.

```
./env_setup.sh fastvideo
conda activate fastvideo
```

## ðŸš€ Inference
We recommend using a GPU with 80GB of memory. To run the inference, use the following command:
### FastHunyuan
```bash
# Download the model weight
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/FastHunyuan --local_dir=data/FastHunyuan --repo_type=model
# change the gpu count inside the script
sh scripts/inference/inference_hunyuan.sh
```
You can also inference FastHunyuan in the [official Hunyuan github](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo).
### FastMochi
You can use FastMochi

```bash
# Download the model weight
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/FastMochi-diffusers --local_dir=data/FastMochi-diffusers --repo_type=model
# CLI inference
bash scripts/inference/inference_mochi_sp.sh
```

## Distillation
Please refer to the [distillation guide](docs/distillation.md).

## Finetuning
Please refer to the [finetuning guide](docs/finetuning.md).
