# Contributing to FastVideo

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FastVideo. We want to make the process as smooth for you as possible and this is a guide to help get you started!

Our community is open to everyone and welcomes any contributions no matter how large or small.

# Developer Environment:
Do make sure you have CUDA 12.4 installed and supported. FastVideo currently only support Linux and CUDA GPUs, but we hope to support other platforms in the future.

We recommend using a fresh Python 3.10 Conda environment to develop FastVideo:

Install Miniconda:

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

Create and activate a Conda environment for FastVideo:

```
conda create -n fastvideo python=3.10 -y
conda activate fastvideo
```

Clone the FastVideo repository and go to the FastVideo directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git && cd vllm

```

Now you can install FastVideo and setup git hooks for running linting. By using `pre-commit`, the linters will run and have to pass before you'll be able to make a commit.

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]

# Can also install flash-attn (optional)
pip install flash-attn==2.7.0.post2 --no-build-isolation 

# Linting, formatting and static type checking
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg

# You can manually run pre-commit with
pre-commit run --all-files

# Unit tests
pytest tests/
```
